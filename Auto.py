# Step 1: Start a nameserver
# Every run needs a nameserver. It could be a 'static' server with a
# permanent address, but here it will be started for the local machine with the default port.
# The nameserver manages the concurrent running workers across all possible threads or clusternodes.
# Note the run_id argument. This uniquely identifies a run of any HpBandSter optimizer.
NS = hpns.NameServer(run_id='rnn', host='127.0.0.1', port=None)
NS.start()

# Step 2: Start a worker
# Now we can instantiate a worker, providing the mandatory information
# Besides the sleep_interval, we need to define the nameserver information and
# the same run_id as above. After that, we can start the worker in the background,
# where it will wait for incoming configurations to evaluate.
# w = MyWorker(sleep_interval = 0, nameserver='127.0.0.1',run_id='example1')
w = worker(run_id = "rnn")
w.run(background=True)

# Step 3: Run an optimizer
# Now we can create an optimizer object and start the run.
# Here, we run BOHB, but that is not essential.
# The run method will return the `Result` that contains all runs performed.
bohb = BOHB(  configspace = w.get_configspace(),
              run_id = 'rnn', nameserver='127.0.0.1',

res = bohb.run(n_iterations=n_iterations)

# Step 4: Shutdown
# After the optimizer run, we must shutdown the master and the nameserver.
bohb.shutdown(shutdown_workers=True)
NS.shutdown()

# Step 5: Analysis
# Each optimizer returns a hpbandster.core.result.Result object.
# It holds informations about the optimization run like the incumbent (=best) configuration.
# For further details about the Result object, see its documentation.
# Here we simply print out the best config and some statistics about the performed runs.
